## Installation
### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. To integrate Aspect into your Xcode project, specify it in your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/iKrisLiu/Aspect", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Aspect into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "iKrisLiu/Aspect" ~> 1.0
```

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To integrate Aspect into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Aspect', '~> 1.0'
```
